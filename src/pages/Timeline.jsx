    details: `The campaign period is when democracy comes alive.

Corporations and foreign nationals are typically prohibited from donating.\n\n**Blackout periods:**\nMany countries prohibit campaign advertising in the final 24–48 hours before Election Day.`,

    summary: 'Election officials systematically count all ballots, including in-person, early, and mail-in votes.',
    details: `After polls close, the meticulous process of counting every vote begins. This is one of the most carefully observed stages of the election.\n\n**Types of ballots counted:**\n• Election Day ballots (in-person)\n• Early voting ballots\n• Absentee/mail-in ballots (often take longest)\n• Provisional ballots (counted last, after eligibility verification)\n\n**How counting works:**\n• Ballots are scanned and tabulated by machines\n• Results are reported precinct-by-precinct\n• Party representatives (poll watchers) observe the process\n• Any damaged ballots are reviewed by bipartisan panels\n\n**Why does it take time?**\nMail-in ballots must be verified (signature matching), and in close races every vote must be painstakingly confirmed. Large elections with millions of voters naturally take longer.\n\n**Media projections vs. official results:**\nNews networks often "call" races based on statistical models before official counting is complete. These projections are educated estimates, not official results.`,

    title: 'Certification',
    duration: 'Days to weeks after Election Day',
    summary: 'Election officials formally certify the results after verification, resolving any recounts or legal challenges.',
    details: `Certification is the official process of declaring the results final and legally binding. It involves multiple layers of verification.\n\n**Steps in certification:**\n1. **Canvassing** — Election officials review all ballots and reconcile the count\n2. **Recount requests** — If a margin is very close, candidates can request a manual recount\n3. **Legal challenges** — Candidates can file court challenges to dispute results\n4. **Certification meeting** — Local officials officially certify their jurisdiction's results\n5. **State/national certification** — Higher authorities aggregate and certify all local results\n\n**Who certifies?**\nIn the US: County Boards → State Canvassing Boards → Secretary of State → Congress (for federal elections)\n\n**Post-certification:**\nOnce certified, results are legally final. Any further challenges must go through the courts, which set a very high bar for overturning certified results.`,
    tips: [
      'Certification deadlines vary by jurisdiction',

    duration: 'Weeks to months after certification',
    summary: 'The winner officially assumes office, marking the peaceful transfer of power — the hallmark of democracy.',
    details: `The inauguration is the ceremonial and legal act of the elected official taking office. It marks the culmination of the entire election process.\n\n**The transition period:**\nBetween certification and inauguration, the incoming and outgoing officials often cooperate on a smooth handover. In the US, this "lame duck" period lasts about 10 weeks (November → January 20).\n\n**The inauguration ceremony typically includes:**\n• Taking the **Oath of Office** — a legally binding promise to uphold the constitution\n• Delivery of an **inaugural address** — the new leader's vision for their term\n• **Ceremonial festivities** — parades, balls, and public celebrations\n\n**Why it matters:**\nThe peaceful transfer of power is considered one of the defining features of a healthy democracy. It demonstrates that leadership transitions happen through votes, not through force.\n\n**International observers:**\nMajor elections often attract international observers who certify the process was free and fair, lending global credibility to the outcome.`,
    tips: [
      'The oath of office is a binding legal commitment',
